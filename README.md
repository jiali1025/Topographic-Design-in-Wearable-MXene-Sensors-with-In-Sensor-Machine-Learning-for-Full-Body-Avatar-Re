# Deep_learning_enabled_whole_body_motion_tracking_with_wireless_strain_sensor
This is the repo for the project Topographical Design in Wireless Strain Sensor for Deep Learning-Enabled Whole-Body Motion Tracking

This repo contains the code for analysing the bluetooth data from the whole body motion tracking device, the code for training of the deep learning model for continuous motion tracking, the code for using svm to realize the motion classification as well as the code for dimension reduction to visulize the data.


After the images are predicted and drawed by our codes, we used https://imgflip.com/gif-maker to create the gif file
